       "# 🌌 What is a Supernova?\n",
       "\n",
       "A **supernova** is an incredibly **powerful** and **rare** astronomical event in which a star explodes, releasing a massive amount of **energy** and **elements** into space. It is one of the most **violent** and **spectacular** events in the universe, outshining an entire galaxy of stars and expelling a vast amount of gas, dust, and heavy elements into the surrounding interstellar medium.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Types of Supernovae\n",
       "\n",
       "There are two main types of supernovae:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Type I**: These occur when a white dwarf star in a binary system accumulates material from a companion star, eventually reaching a critical mass that triggers a **thermonuclear explosion**.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Type II**: These occur when a massive star (at least 8-10 times the mass of the sun) runs out of fuel and collapses under its own gravity, leading to a massive explosion.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Characteristics of Supernovae\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Energy Output**: The explosion can be so powerful that it can be seen from millions of light-years away, briefly outshining an entire galaxy.\n",
       "2. **Element Expulsion**: Heavy elements like **iron**, **nickel**, and **gold** are forged in the star's core during the explosion and are then dispersed into space.\n",
       "3. **Role in the Universe**: Supernovae play a crucial role in the evolution of the universe by helping to distribute heavy elements, seeding the formation of new stars and planets, and regulating galaxy growth.\n",
       "4. **Scientific Importance**: They provide unique opportunities to study extreme physics and gain insights into the fundamental laws governing matter and energy.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Examples of Notable Supernovae\n",
       "- **SN 1987A**: A Type II supernova that occurred in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way.\n",
       "- **SN 1006**: A Type Ia supernova that was visible from Earth for several months.\n",
       "- **Tycho's Supernova**: A Type Ia supernova observed in 1572 by Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe.\n",
       "\n",
