    "A coroutine is an async function (created with async def) that can pause and resume.\n",
    "Calling an async function returns a coroutine object (not the result). It must be awaited or scheduled.\n",
    "What does await do?\n",
    "await pauses the current coroutine until the awaited awaitable (another coroutine, Task, or Future) completes.\n",
    "While paused, the event loop can run other coroutines → concurrency without threads.\n",
    "Why it matters\n",
    "Avoids blocking the event loop on I/O (HTTP calls, DB, sleep).\n",
    "Improves throughput for many small I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "Rules\n",
